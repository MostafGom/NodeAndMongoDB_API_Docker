# Node App and MongoDB using Docker

### this app uses two service:
#### official Node:20
#### official MongoDB
#### running on the same network 

### Before running the containers create network first:
```console
docker network create mylocalnetwork
```
#### Make sure you define your env values in .env file





#### Inside docker-compose.yml directory run:
```console
docker compose up
```
### Or if you need to run in the background withour blocking the terminal run:
```console
docker compose up -d
```

#### to install any new packages in your node app run the following
```console
docker exec -it ${your_node_container_name} bash
```
#### now you are inside the docker container you can install any packages and you can create files inside your appsrc directory and will be reflected inside your code on local machine


#### In this Node App I made:
1. basic JWT auth with access and refresh tokens
2. refresh tokens set as httponly and is allowed through samesite=none
3. defined JWT helper methods to be easily reusable throughout the proejct
4. defined custom logging system
5. inside Rest_Client_files directory you can define test cases to quickly check if everything is working with the help of VScode extension ["REST Client"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client)

#### My docker and docker compose versions:

#### Docker Engine - Community
#### Version: 24.0.7

#### Docker Compose 
#### version v2.21.0

A note you can avoid exposing any ports on any containers on your server
and you can have reverse proxy service on the same network to proxy traffic to wordpress
without exposing any unneeded ports
